### **What Is Docker?**

Docker is an open-source containerization platform used for developing, deploying, and managing applications in lightweight virtualized environments called containers.

It is mainly used as a software development platform for developing distributed applications that work efficiently in different environments. By making the software system agnostic, developers donâ€™t have to worry about compatibility issues. Packaging apps into isolated environments (containers) also makes it easier to develop, deploy, maintain, and use applications.

Since Docker utilizes virtualization to create containers for storing apps, the concept may seem similar to virtual machines. Although both represent isolated virtual environments used for software development, there are important differences between containers and VMs. The most crucial distinction is that Docker containers are lighter, faster, and more resource efficient than virtual machines.

### **What Are Containers?**
Docker containers are lightweight virtualized runtime environments for running applications. Each container represents a package of software that contains code, system tools, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files required for running a specific application. They are independent and isolated from the host and other instances running on the host.

Containers are based on Docker images. You build a container by running an image on the Docker Engine. As these are the most common Docker terms, make sure you understand the difference between Docker images and Docker containers.

The same hardware can host multiple containers. Unlike virtual machines, containers virtualize at the application level. Therefore, they share the OS kernel with the host and virtualize an operating system on top of it. This means you use less resources and maintain lightweight virtual environments that are quick and easy to configure.


### **What Is Docker Used For?**
- Running multiple workloads on fewer resources.
- Isolating and segregating applications.
- Standardizing environments to ensure consistency across development and release cycles.
- Streamlining the development lifecycle and supporting CI/CD workflows.
- Developing highly portable workloads that can run on multi-cloud platforms.
- Additionally, it is used as:

- A cost-effective alternative to virtual machines.
- A version control system for an application.
